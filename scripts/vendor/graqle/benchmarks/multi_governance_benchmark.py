Multi-Governance Benchmark — 3-Tier Evaluation for Graqle.

Tier A: Single-Regulation (10 questions)
    Tests basic retrieval within one regulation.
    Single-agent should perform reasonably here.

Tier B: Cross-Regulation (10 questions)
    Tests reasoning across 2 regulations (e.g., AI Act + GDPR).
    GraQle advantage: PCST activates nodes from both frameworks.

Tier C: Complex Inter-Domain (10 questions)
    Tests reasoning across 3+ regulations with conditional logic.
    GraQle should significantly outperform: requires message passing
    across distant nodes, conflict detection, and hierarchical aggregation.

This benchmark demonstrates GraQle's core thesis:
    "Graph topology-aware distributed reasoning outperforms
     single-agent approaches on multi-hop regulatory queries."
