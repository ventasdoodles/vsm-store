Multi-Governance Knowledge Graph — EU AI Act + GDPR + DORA + NIS2.

A dense, interconnected regulatory KG with THICK nodes containing actual
article text AND supporting evidence chunks. Each node carries 3-5 chunks

Nodes: ~32 entities with full article text (500-1500 chars each)
Chunks: ~4 per node (Q&A, enforcement, implementation, cross-references)
Edges: ~40 relationships with typed connections
Frameworks: EU AI Act, GDPR, DORA, NIS2
